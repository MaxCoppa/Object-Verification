# Utils  

The utils module provides a collection of reusable components that support the object verification pipeline.  
It centralizes functionality for image preprocessing, model evaluation, configuration management, and ONNX export, ensuring consistency and reducing code duplication across the project.

## Submodules

- **image_utils** - Image loading, preprocessing, cropping, anonymization, and visualization.  
- **model_utils** - Losses, similarity functions, predictions, metrics, and evaluation plots.  
- **config_utils** - Configuration parsing and management.  
- **onnx_utils** - Utilities for exporting and handling ONNX models.

## Purpose

This module ensures modularity and consistency by grouping all auxiliary utilities required across datasets, models, and evaluation pipelines.
