# Training and Evaluation for Siamese Verification Models  

This module provides the training, validation, and evaluation components of the object verification pipeline.  
It implements reproducible training routines, best-model checkpointing, and standardized evaluation metrics to ensure robust performance assessment of Siamese neural networks.

## Training Workflow  

- Alternates between training and validation phases at each epoch.  
- Tracks key metrics such as loss and ROC AUC during training.  
- Saves the best-performing model weights based on validation AUC.  
- Supports optional visualization of learning curves (e.g., ROC AUC progression).  

---

## Evaluation Workflow  

- Runs inference across the full test set of image pairs or triplets.  
- Computes core verification metrics including ROC AUC, False Rejection Rate (FRR), and threshold-based statistics.  
- Produces detailed per-sample predictions as a `pandas.DataFrame` for traceability and error analysis.

## Metrics  

- **ROC AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve):** Measures separability between genuine and impostor pairs.  
- **False Rejection Rate (FRR):** Likelihood of rejecting a genuine pair at a given threshold.  
- **Threshold Analysis:** Determines operating points tailored to different application security requirements.  
- **Quartile Statistics:** Summarizes performance distribution for more granular insights.

- Detailed evaluation reports including per-sample outputs.  
- Logging utilities to ensure transparency and reproducibility.  
- Optional plotting of training and validation performance metrics.  
- Seamless integration with the dataset preloader and verification models modules.
