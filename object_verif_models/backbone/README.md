# Backbone Architectures  

This directory is reserved for defining or extending backbones used in Siamese models.  

- Default backbones (e.g., ResNet variants) are integrated through `object_verif_models`.  
- Custom architectures can be added here to extend the pipeline with new feature extractors.  

> Note: This folder is currently empty. It is included to provide a clear extension point for future work.
