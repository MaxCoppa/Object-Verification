# Object-Verification
Given two objects determine whether they represent the same thing or not

Idea : Crop type : crop ==> if we wnat to crop or not the image / for images COCO

To do : 
- Verify no xml / vehicle / car / radar... 
- Change configs too specific only one too much here
- Distances / Predictions ==> Private / put smthg more simple public ? 
- Do ReadME.md 
- Change the init of the project properly
- Add a second data base made of birds (to test)

- For the train : do smthg like train on ... test on ... (do I use a configs file or not ?)
- Check the PATH / Project/ path ... 
- executable or not ?
